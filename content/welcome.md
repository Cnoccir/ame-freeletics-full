# Welcome to AME TechAssist

This forum is our internal hub for sharing knowledge, solving problems, and documenting what actually works in the field.

Everything here rolls up into four main areas:

## Assistance
When you're stuck right now, this is where you ask for help. Post your screenshots, error codes, field notes, and what you've tried so far. Once we confirm a solution, we'll move the thread into **Insights** so others can benefit.

## Insights
This is our library of field-proven fixes and lessons learned. If you solved something interesting or found a clever workaround, document it here so the next tech doesn't have to re-solve the same problem.

## Guides
This is where we keep step-by-step walkthroughs and standard procedures. Think "playbooks" for common tasks and setups — written so anyone on the team can follow them start to finish.

## Resources
A read-only shelf for official documentation: manufacturer manuals, spec sheets, code references, and firmware downloads. If you need a data sheet or official guidance, look here first.

## Quick Reference

Use this quick routing flow when you're not sure where to post:

- **Stuck right now?** → Post in **Assistance**.
- **Found a fix / something cool?** → Post in **Insights**.
- **Teaching a skill or process?** → Post in **Guides**.
- **Need a manual or spec?** → Search in **Resources**.

## AI Assistant (AME-Bot)

We also have an **AI Assistant (AME-Bot)** that will be connected to our AME knowledge base through an n8n-powered workflow. The goal is to let you:

- Ask quick "how do I…" questions.
- Pull up relevant guides and resources.
- Get starting points for troubleshooting.

For now, use the **AI Assistant** card on the homepage to try it out. As we improve it, we'll keep this topic updated with tips and examples.

Thanks for helping build this into a living playbook for the whole team.
